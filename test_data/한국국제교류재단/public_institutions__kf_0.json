The exhibition is held from December 28, 2021, to February 19, 2022. It is the first feature exhibition in Korea of Belgian-born international photographer Frederik Buyckx (b. 1984), who was named Photographer of the Year at the 2017 SONY World Photography Awards, the world's most prestigious photography honor.The title of the exhibition, Horse Head, comes from the artist's first trip to Kyrgyzstan, which inspired the series of works. Staying in At-Bashy, a small village where he witnessed the traditional horseback game of kok-boru being played, the artist became deeply moved by the local semi-nomadic shepherds' traditional way of life and their connection with horses. Buyckx decided to visit Kyrgyzstan again just two months after his first trip had ended. Kyrgyzstan's harsh cold and the symbiotic life of humans and animals that migrate some 100 kilometers together in such frigid weather came across as refreshingly shocking and fascinating to him. After witnessing humans and animals expanding their territories of life in the brutal wilderness, interdependent on one another, Buyckx chose the name of the village AtBashy, which translates to \"horse head,\" as the title of this powerful project in respect and remembrance of these phenomenal migrations.| Magnum photographer Bieke Depoorter writes, \u201cIn Frederik's photographs, you can almost feel the wind cut through your skin as you journey by horse through the snow-covered landscape.\" As described, Buyckx's blackand-white photographs emphasize the overwhelming majesty and beauty of Kyrgyzstan's unpredictable nature, as they allow viewers to become absorbed by the landscapes. The figures in the images sometimes seem like they are advancing towards the snowy mountains, and other times like they are disappearing from their settlements; the images soon turn into empty yet solemn monumental landscapes.This exhibition was made possible through a special cooperation withthe Embassy of Kyrgyzstan in Korea. In carrying out the Horse Head project,Buyckx formed a profound bond with the semi-nomadic community of Kyrgyzstan, and the resulting photographs visualize the massive landscapes that nomads encounter as they roam, presenting an opportunity for viewers to immerse themselves deeply into nomadic life. The works in themselves are reminders of At-Bashy's semi-nomadic community and can be seen as a process of archiving Kyrgyz heritage.Zelda Chitle, chair of judges at the SONY World Photography Awards, explained, \u201cThe work of Buyckx returns to the essence of looking at photography. A landscape is often overlooked but it is central to our existence.\" While people today often forget this, the relationship between humans and nature is one of the most vital and essential relationships for all of the earth's inhabitants. The people of At-Bashy live in an environment that is utterly different from those of Seoul, Korea, and Brussels, Belgium. This exhibition, held in the cold winter of 2021 in celebration of the 120 year-long diplomatic ties between Korea and Belgium, is expected to serve as platform for cultural exchange, allowing visitors to encounter the landscapes of diverse regions and experience the multiple layers of life.\uccab\ub208 First Snow, 2016-2019 \ud30c\uc778\uc544\ud2b8\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc544\uce74\uc774\ubc8c \ud53c\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \uc789\ud06c \ud504\ub9b0\ud2b8 Archival pigment ink on fine art paper 130 \u00d7 195cm\uc591 \ub5bc 1 Sheep Herd 1, 2016 - 2019 \ud30c\uc778\uc544\ud2b8\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc544\uce74\uc774\ubc8c \ud53c\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \uc789\ud06c \ud504\ub9b0\ud2b8 Archival pigment ink on fine art paper 130 \u00d7 195cm\uc0b0 \uc18d\uc758 \uc9d1 Mountain House, 2016 - 2019\ud30c\uc778\uc544\ud2b8\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc544\uce74\uc774\ubc8c \ud53c\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \uc789\ud06c \ud504\ub9b0\ud2b8 Archival pigment ink on fine art paper 190 \u00d7 135cm\ucf55\ubcf4\ub8e8(\uc804\ud1b5 \ub9d0 \uac8c\uc784) Kok-boru(A traditional horse game), 2016 - 2019 \ud30c\uc778\uc544\ud2b8\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc774\uce74\uc774\ubc8c \ud53c\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \uc789\ud06c \ud504\ub9b0\ud2b8 Archival pigment ink on fine art paper 190 x 135cmKF \uac24\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\uc2dc \uac1c\ub9c9\uc77c\ubd80\ud130 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc608\uc57d\uc81c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The Korea Foundation and the Embassy of Belgium in Korea present HorseHead, an exhibition commemorating the 120th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Korea and Belgium, at the KF Gallery and online as VR exhibition. The exhibition is held from December 28, 2021, to February 9, 2022. Itis the first feature exhibition in Korea of Belgian-born international photographer Frederik Buyckx (b. 1984), who was named Photographer of the Yearat the 2017 SONY World Photography Awards, the world\u2019s most prestigiousphotography honor.The title of the exhibition, Horse Head, comes from the artist's first tripto Kyrgyzstan, which inspired the series of works. Staying in At-Bashy, asmall village where he witnessed the traditional horseback game of Kok-boru being played, the artist became deeply moved by the local semi-nomadicshepherds\u2019 traditional way of life and their connection with horses. Buyckxdecided to visit Kyrgyzstan again just two months after his first trip had ended. Kyrgyzstan\u2019s harsh cold and the symbiotic life of humans and animalsthat migrate some 100 kilometers together in such frigid weather cameacross as refreshingly shocking and fascinating to him. After witnessing humans and animals expanding their territories of life in the brutal wilderness,interdependent on one another, Buyckx chose the name of the village At Bashy, which translates to \u201chorse head,\u201d as the title of this powerful projectin respect and remembrance of these phenomenal migrations.Magnum photographer Bieke Depoorter writes, \u201cIn Frederik\u2019s photographs, you can almost feel the wind cut through your skin as you journey byhorse through the snow-covered landscape.\u201d As described, Buyckx\u2019s black-and-white photographs emphasize the overwhelming majesty and beautyof Kyrgyzstan\u2019s unpredictable nature, as they allow viewers to become absorbed by the landscapes. The figures in the images sometimes seem likethey are advancing towards the snowy mountains, and other times like theyare disappearing from their settlements; the images soon turn into emptyyet solemn monumental landscapes.This exhibition was made possible through a special cooperation withthe Embassy of Kyrgyzstan in Korea. In carrying out the Horse Head project,Buyckx formed a profound bond with the semi-nomadic community of Kyrgyzstan, and the resulting photographs visualize the massive landscapesthat nomads encounter as they roam, presenting an opportunity for viewersto immerse themselves deeply into nomadic life. The works in themselvesare reminders of At-Bashy\u2019s semi-nomadic community and can be seen as aprocess of archiving Kyrgyz heritage.Zelda Chitle, chair of judges at the SONY World Photography Awards,explained, \u201cThe work of Buyckx returns to the essence of looking at photography. A landscape is often overlooked but it is central to our existence.\u201dWhile people today often forget this, the relationship between humansand nature is one of the most vital and essential relationships for all of theearth\u2019s inhabitants. The people of At-Bashy live in an environment that isutterly different from those of Seoul, Korea, and Brussels, Belgium. This ehibition, held in the cold winter of 2021 in celebration of the 120 year-longdiplomatic ties between Korea and Belgium, is expected to serve as platformfor cultural exchange, allowing visitors to encounter the landscapes of diverse regions and experience the multiple layers of life. \uccab\ub208 First Snow, 2016-2019\ud30c\uc778\uc544\ud2b8\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc544\uce74\uc774\ubc8c \ud53c\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \uc789\ud06c \ud504\ub9b0\ud2b8 Archival pigment ink on fine art paper 130 x 195cm \uc591\ub54c ISheepHerd 1,2016-2019\ud30c\uc778\uc544\ud2b8\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc544\uce74\uc774\ubc8c \ud53c\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \uc789\ud06c \ud504\ub9b0\ud2b8 Archival pigment ink on fine art paper 130 x 195cm \uc0b0 \uc18d\uc758 \uc9d1 Mountain House, 2016-2019\ud30c\uc778\uc544\ud2b8\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc544\uce74\uc774\ubc8c \ud53c\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \uc789\ud06c \ud504\ub9b0\ud2b8 Archival pigment ink on fine art paper 90 x 135cm \ucf55-\ubcf4\ub8e8(\uc804\ud1b5 \ub9d0 \uac8c\uc784) Kok-boru (A traditional horse game), 2016-2019\ud30c\uc778\uc544\ud2b8\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc544\uce74\uc774\ubc8c \ud53c\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \uc789\ud06c \ud504\ub9b0\ud2b8 Archival pigment ink on fine art paper 90 x 135cm KF \uac24\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\uc2dc \uac1c\ub9c9\uc77c\ubd80\ud130 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc608\uc57d\uc81c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
